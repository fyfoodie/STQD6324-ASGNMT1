# Uncovering Drug Overdose Mortality Trends for Public Actions

This project explores the patterns of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2023 using open-source mortality data from the CDC.

The goal is to uncover which **age groups**, **genders**, and **drug types** are most affected â€” and how these patterns have shifted over time â€” to support more focused public health interventions.
